          <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
          <p>
            <br/>
            Predicting mango variety using image processing is a relatively recent development in the field of agricultural technology. 
            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be particularly effective for fruit classification due to their ability 
            to capture intricate patterns and features in images. Studies such as the work by Shrivastava et al. (2020) have 
            demonstrated the use of CNNs for identifying different mango varieties with high accuracy, showing that deep learning 
            models can successfully differentiate between varieties based on visual characteristics.
            <br/><br/>
            Leaf disease identification using image processing is a well-established area of research, with CNNs being widely employed 
            due to their superior performance in image recognition tasks. The techniques used have evolved significantly, moving from 
            basic image preprocessing and feature extraction methods to more sophisticated deep learning models. For example, 
            Sladojevic et al. (2016) have illustrated the effectiveness of CNNs in identifying multiple plant diseases with high 
            precision, highlighting the potential for these models to be applied to various crops, including mangoes.
            <br/><br/>
            While significant progress has been made in the identification of leaf diseases, the automated recommendation of prevention 
            strategies remains less explored. Most studies focus on the identification of diseases, creating a gap in the research 
            related to actionable recommendations for disease management. Research by Picon et al. (2019) discusses the potential of 
            integrating image processing with expert systems to recommend treatments, suggesting that further development is needed to 
            bridge the gap between disease identification and prevention strategies. This integration could provide a comprehensive 
            solution for managing plant health in mango orchards.
            <br/><br/>
            The use of image processing for predicting ripeness and grading of mangoes is gaining traction as a practical application 
            of CNNs. These models can analyze visual cues such as color, texture, and shape to determine the ripeness of the fruit. 
            Research by Sarker et al. (2019) has shown that CNN-based models can grade fruits with substantial accuracy, indicating 
            their potential for practical use in sorting and grading processes. Such advancements can significantly aid in ensuring the 
            quality and market value of mango produce by categorizing them into different grades based on their ripeness.
            <br/><br/>
            Mango Bloosom Application cultivation covers a broad spectrum, from variety prediction and disease identification to 
            ripeness prediction and grading. However, there remains a notable research gap in the integration of these tasks into a 
            single, cohesive system, and in the development of automated prevention strategy recommendations post disease identification. 
            Addressing these gaps can lead to the development of comprehensive solutions that enhance the management and optimization of 
            mango orchards. By leveraging the capabilities of CNNs and deep learning, it is possible to create a system that not only 
            identifies issues but also provides actionable recommendations, ultimately benefiting mango producers through improved 
            efficiency and productivity.

  enhancing overall efficiency and usability for farmers.
</p>
<br>
<h5>Research Gap for Domain 2: Disease Prevention Recommendations </h5>
<p>
  While disease identification using CNNs is well-researched, there is a notable gap in providing actionable prevention strategies post 
  diagnosis. Existing studies primarily concentrate on the accurate detection of diseases, but they often stop short of suggesting 
  practical measures to mitigate these issues. Developing systems that not only identify diseases but also recommend specific, 
  evidence-based prevention strategies would be invaluable for effective orchard management and disease control.
</p> 
 
<br> 
<h5>Research Gap for Domain 3: Real-Time Application </h5>
<p>
  Implementing these advanced image processing techniques in real-time scenarios presents significant challenges. Real-time application 
  requires robust computational resources and efficient algorithms capable of operating under varying environmental conditions. The 
  current state of research has yet to fully address these practical limitations, which include handling large datasets, ensuring fast 
  processing times, and maintaining accuracy in diverse and dynamic orchard environments. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for 
  creating practical, on-the-ground solutions that can be widely adopted by mango farmers.
</p>

<br>
<h5>Research Gap Overall Summary:  </h5>
<p>
  Addressing these research gaps involves developing integrated systems that combine variety prediction, disease identification, and 
  ripeness grading, enhancing the functionality and practicality of these technologies. Additionally, incorporating disease prevention 
  recommendations and optimizing algorithms for real-time application are essential steps toward making these advancements more 
  accessible and beneficial for the agricultural sector.

          <h2> Research Problem</h2>
		  <br>
          <p>Mango orchards face numerous challenges that impact productivity and quality, including the accurate identification of 
            mango varieties, timely detection and management of leaf diseases, and effective grading of mango ripeness. Current 
            technologies often address these issues in isolation, lacking a cohesive approach that integrates all aspects of orchard 
            management into a single system. This fragmentation results in inefficiencies and missed opportunities for optimizing 
            production and quality.
            <br/><br/>
          </p>
          <h5>The Need for Integration </h5>
          <p>
            The identification of mango varieties is crucial for various agricultural and commercial purposes. Different varieties have 
            unique growth requirements, market values, and disease susceptibilities. Accurate and timely identification can aid in 
            better management practices and marketing strategies. While CNNs have shown high accuracy in fruit classification, their 
            application remains limited to standalone tasks without integration into broader management systems.
          </p>
          <br/><br/>
          <h5>Disease Identification and Management </h5>
          <p>
            Leaf diseases significantly affect mango yield and quality. Early detection and management are vital to prevent widespread 
            damage. Although CNNs have proven effective in identifying plant diseases, the transition from identification to actionable 
            prevention strategies is underdeveloped. Existing research often stops at detection, leaving a gap in the practical 
            application of these findings to suggest and implement preventive measures. This gap needs addressing to provide a complete 
            solution that encompasses both detection and management.
          </p>
          <br/><br/>
          <h5>Ripeness Prediction and Grading </h5>
          <p>
            Ripeness prediction and grading are essential for ensuring mangoes meet market standards and consumer expectations. Proper 
            grading based on ripeness can maximize market value and reduce post-harvest losses. CNNs can analyze visual cues such as 
            color and texture to determine ripeness stages, but their application is often restricted to controlled environments and 
            not integrated with other orchard management tasks.
          </p>
          <br/><br/>
          <h5>Real-Time Application Challenges </h5>
          <p>
            Implementing these technologies in real-time scenarios presents additional challenges. Mango orchards are dynamic 
            environments where lighting, weather, and other conditions vary, complicating the deployment of image processing systems. 
            Real-time application requires robust computational resources and efficient algorithms capable of maintaining accuracy and 
            speed under diverse conditions. Overcoming these practical limitations is crucial for the widespread adoption of these 
            technologies in real-world settings.
          </p>
          <br/><br/>
          <h5>Comprehensive Solution </h5>
          <p>
            The research problem, therefore, is to develop an integrated image processing system using CNNs that can simultaneously 
            predict mango varieties, identify leaf diseases, recommend preventive strategies, and grade mango ripeness. Such a system 
            would streamline orchard management by providing a unified platform for all these tasks, enhancing efficiency and 
            productivity. The system should be capable of real-time operation, adapting to the dynamic conditions of mango orchards. 
            Addressing these research gaps will result in a comprehensive tool that supports farmers in making informed decisions, 
            ultimately leading to better management practices, improved yield, and higher-quality mangoes.

          <h2> Methodology</h2>  
          <br><br>
          </p>
          <h5>Data Collection and Dataset Preparation</h5>
          <p>
            To enhance the accuracy of the model, a dataset consisting of nearly 1000 images was collected from mango orchards in 
            Munthalama and Jaffna. Additionally, 2000 images were sourced from Kaggle. Subsequently, the dataset was filtered to remove 
            unclear images. To facilitate disease identification, the dataset was organized into five folders, each corresponding 
            to a specific disease. The images were then placed into the respective folders based on the type of disease they depicted. 
            Field visits were conducted to gather data and information for research. One visit was made to Prof. Nishantha Giguruwa's 
            mango orchard in Mundalama, while another visit was undertaken to a mango orchard in the Jaffna area. These visits provided 
            valuable insights and data for the study. Furthermore, the collection of diseased fruit images and information on disease 
            prevention strategies was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Nishantha Giguruwa and Suni Galearachchi, a Consultant 
            Agronomist. Their expertise and guidance significantly contributed to the success of this research. These efforts 
            collectively contributed to the development of a robust dataset for training and testing the CNN models, enabling accurate 
            identification and classification of mango fruit diseases.
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <h5>Data Augmentation </h5>
          <p>
            Image augmentation is a crucial technique used to expand datasets artificially, especially when working with limited data. 
            This approach plays a significant role in enhancing the robustness and generalization capability of machine learning models. 
            In our study, we employed the image augmenter provided by the Keras library to augment our dataset. By manipulating various 
            augmentation parameters, we were able to generate additional images from a single image, effectively increasing the size of 
            our dataset. Our augmentation process involved setting several parameters to create diverse variations of the original images.
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <h5>Model Development </h5>
          <p>
            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), renowned for their efficacy in image classification tasks, were selected as the 
            primary model for mango cultivar classification. These deep learning algorithms were adapted to accommodate the specific 
            nuances and characteristics of mango cultivars, ensuring optimal classification outcomes. A suitable CNN architecture was 
            selected based on considerations such as computational efficiency, accuracy, and classification performance. The CNN model 
            underwent training using the augmented dataset, enabling accurate identification and differentiation of mango cultivars 
            based on their unique attributes. By implementing this methodology, the research aims to develop a robust system capable of 
            accurately classifying and distinguishing various mango cultivars, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in mango 
            cultivation and management practices.
